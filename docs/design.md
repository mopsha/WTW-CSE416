## Data model (Alan)

Postgres (Supabase) is the source of truth. Clients read through RLS; **only our API writes** (service role).
Columns below are the ones the decision engine relies on; Razin's migration is authoritative for the rest.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | One row per account (created on first sign-in). |
| `friendships` | Friend requests, accepted friends, blocks. |
| `groups`, `group_members` | Reusable groups for repeat Picks. |
| `picks` | One decision session: host, category, center + radius, deadline, close threshold, state, and the stored winner (`winner_place_id`, `decided_at`, `decided_by`). |
| `pick_participants` | Who is in a Pick and whether they finished swiping. |
| `pick_join_codes` | 6-character join codes / QR / `wtw://join/CODE` links. |
| `places`, `place_cache` | Normalized provider places; cached provider data (30-day TTL, subject to Google's terms). |
| `pick_candidates` | The fixed, shared pool for one Pick (snapshot, so history does not change when a place does). |
| `preferences` | Each participant's private Yes/Maybe/No per candidate. |
| `ranking_results` | Output of the ranking engine for a Pick. |
| `final_votes` | One ballot per participant among the finalists. |
| `notifications`, `push_tokens` | Invitation and Pick-status notifications. |
| `saved_places` | Ideas saved from Discover. |

## Pick state machine (Alan)

Code: `supabase/functions/_shared/domain/pickState.ts` (`canTransition(from, to, actor)`; `dueToClose` for the deadline / close-threshold rule).
The API is the only writer of `picks.state` and rejects every action that does not belong to the current state
(for example a swipe after ranking, or a vote for a non-finalist).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft : host creates Pick
    draft --> swiping : host starts
    swiping --> ranking : host closes / system at deadline or close threshold
    ranking --> completed : system, clear winner
    ranking --> final_vote : system, no clear winner
    final_vote --> completed : system, all voted or deadline
    draft --> canceled : host / system
    swiping --> canceled : host / system
    ranking --> canceled : host / system
    final_vote --> canceled : host / system
    completed --> [*]
    canceled --> [*]
```

| From → To | Host | Participant | System |
|---|---|---|---|
| draft → swiping | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| swiping → ranking | ✅ (close manually) | ❌ | ✅ (deadline, or X% finished) |
| ranking → completed | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (clear winner) |
| ranking → final_vote | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (no clear winner) |
| final_vote → completed | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (all voted, or deadline) |
| any unfinished → canceled | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (e.g. stale Pick sweep) |
| completed / canceled → anything | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

"System" means our API acting on its own authority: the `pg_cron` deadline sweep, the close-threshold check after a swipe, and the ranking step itself.
Participants never change the state; they only swipe and vote. Refreshing the candidate pool stays in `swiping` (after swiping has started it asks for confirmation and resets everyone's answers).

## Scoring (Alan)

Code: `supabase/functions/_shared/domain/ranking.ts` (`scoreCandidate`, `rankCandidates`, `clearWinner`); tests in `tests/domain/ranking.test.ts`.
This is a transparent formula, not an AI prediction.

**Per candidate**, with `n` participants and answers Yes = 1, Maybe = 0.5, No = 0, **missing = 0.5 (counts as Maybe)**:

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| preference | mean of all `n` values |
| consensus | 1 − (population std-dev of the `n` values ÷ 0.5) |
| coverage | people who actually answered ÷ `n` |
| noProportion | number of No answers ÷ `n` |

```
score = 100 × (0.70·preference + 0.20·consensus + 0.10·coverage) − 15·noProportion,   clamped to 0–100
```

**Worked example: broad enthusiasm with one objection vs. lukewarm agreement**

| Answers (n = 4) | preference | consensus | coverage | noProportion | score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yes, Yes, Yes, No | 0.75 | 0.134 | 1 | 0.25 | **61.4** |
| Maybe × 4 | 0.50 | 1.000 | 1 | 0 | **65.0** |

Complete moderate agreement edges out a divisive option: one strong "No" costs both consensus and the −15 penalty.
Other reference points (all locked by tests): all Yes = 100, all No = 15, nobody answered = 55, 3 Maybe + 1 missing = 62.5.

**Ordering ties:** score (desc) → distance from the Pick center (asc, haversine) → place id (asc). The result is deterministic.

**Clear winner:** if only one candidate exists, or #1 beats #2 by **≥ 10 points**, #1 wins and the final vote is skipped.
Otherwise the group votes among the top 3 (or the 1–2 that exist). If #1 is tied, it is never a clear winner; everyone tied for #1 is a finalist, even if that makes more than 3.
Float noise is ignored (differences under 1e-9 count as equal), so an exact 10-point gap always counts.

**Final-vote tie-break:** most votes → higher score → closer to the center → place id (`voteWinner`; no ballots by the deadline means #1 wins).

**What users see:** rank only (1st / 2nd / 3rd, or "Clear winner!"). Scores are stored in `ranking_results.score` for tests and debugging and are never sent to the app.

**Input mapping:** `preferences.value` is 0 = No, 1 = Maybe, 2 = Yes; `answerFromDb` converts it before scoring.

**Open question for the team:** the weights (0.70 / 0.20 / 0.10, −15) are a starting hypothesis. M5 user sessions should tell us whether one "No" is penalized enough.
